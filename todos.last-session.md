Congrats! That’s a big lift—glad it’s working and doubly so that you got it running in Docker on your first go.

Here are some practical, low-effort improvements to make it easier to maintain and sound even better.

Audio/pipeline improvements

Keep dynaudnorm off the master. If you want more consistency, normalize the voice only, duck the music, and add a safety limiter.
Unify sample rate to 48 kHz for video. Change any -ar 24000 to -ar 48000 in retimeAudio, addLeadInSilence, and the final output. This avoids multiple resamples and matches common video players.
Optional: gentle fades on the music so it feels polished.
Example mix with voice loudnorm + sidechain ducking + limiter + music fade:
async function mixNarrationWithBackground(
narrationPath, backgroundPath, outputPath, ttsLength, musicVolume
) {
const fadeIn = 0.8;
const fadeOut = 1.0;
const fadeOutStart = Math.max(0, ttsLength - fadeOut);
const scThreshold = 0.05; // adjust to taste (lower = more ducking)
await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
ffmpeg()
.input(narrationPath) // 0:a
.input(backgroundPath) // 1:a
.complexFilter([
// Normalize voice and split it so we can use it for sidechain and mix
[0:a]aformat=sample_fmts=fltp:channel_layouts=mono, +
loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=7, +
asplit=2[voiceMix][voiceKey],
// Base music level + gentle fade in/out
[1:a]volume=${musicVolume}, +
afade=t=in:st=0:d=${fadeIn}, +
afade=t=out:st=${fadeOutStart}:d=${fadeOut}[bg],
// Duck music when voice is present
[bg][voiceKey]sidechaincompress=threshold=${scThreshold}:ratio=8:attack=5:release=250[bgduck],
// Mix voice with ducked music, then limit peaks
[voiceMix][bgduck]amix=inputs=2:duration=first:dropout_transition=3, +
alimiter=limit=-1.5dB[a],
])
.outputOptions([
"-map", "[a]",
"-t", ttsLength.toString(),
"-ar", "48000",
"-ac", "2",
"-y",
])
.save(outputPath)
.on("end", resolve)
.on("error", reject);
});
}

Developer ergonomics

Keep temp artifacts optionally: gate cleanup behind an env var so you can inspect failures.
const keep = process.env.KEEP_TEMP === "1";
...
if (!keep) fs.rmSync(work, { recursive: true, force: true });

Better ffmpeg logging when needed:
ffmpeg()
.on("start", c => process.env.FFMPEG_LOGS && console.log("[start]", c))
.on("stderr", l => process.env.FFMPEG_LOGS && console.log(l))
.on("progress", p => process.env.FFMPEG_LOGS && console.log(p));

Pin toolchain: lock Node LTS (e.g., 20), pin ffmpeg-static, @ffprobe-installer/ffprobe, fluent-ffmpeg, and openai SDK versions. Add "engines": { "node": ">=20" } in package.json and use npm ci in CI/Docker to ensure reproducible installs.

Automatic tests (quick wins)

Golden sample test: run a short input and assert the output exists, duration matches narration within a small tolerance.
Loudness check: run ffmpeg -filter_complex ebur128 -f null - and parse the Integrated loudness to keep mixes within target (e.g., -16 to -14 LUFS).
Smoke-test multiple voices/speeds in CI to catch regressions.
Docker tips

Prefer Debian slim over Alpine with ffmpeg-static (glibc vs musl). Example multi-stage:
FROM node:20-slim AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package\*.json ./
RUN npm ci

FROM node:20-slim AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-slim AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends tini && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/\*
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
RUN useradd -m app && chown -R app:app /app
USER app
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/tini", "--"]
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]

.dockerignore: node_modules, dist, .git, logs, temp.

Pass OPENAI_API_KEY at runtime (env or secrets). Avoid baking it into the image.

For dev, mount your project as a volume and use nodemon/tsx to hot-reload.

Keeping it updated

Add Dependabot or Renovate to auto-PR dependency bumps.
CI that builds the image, runs the golden tests, and (optionally) publishes a tagged image.
Version your image and code (e.g., semantic versioning), and keep a simple CHANGELOG.
Nice-to-have features to iterate on

Per-slide timing derived from text (split text and allocate durations by sentence length).
Option for simple transitions (crossfade/xfade) or subtle Ken Burns (zoompan).
CLI wrapper with flags for voice, speed, music volume, image dir, output path.
If you want, share your Dockerfile or CI setup and I’ll tailor it to your repo. And congrats again—getting this far with audio/video + Docker on a first pass is no small feat.
