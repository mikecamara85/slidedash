Slidedash is a utility to produce a video slideshow from an array of image files in seconds

- In the "dist" folder, which will be created when you run "npm run build", you must create a folder named "images" and the image files you want to use should be stored there.

- This has only been tested in Windows, so the below instruction is for Windows.

- You also need to download and unzip FFMPEG on your system and add the full file path to FFMPEG's "bin" folder to PATH on your computer.
- I used the gyan.dev build for Windows as shown here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows
- To unzip this build, you need to also have 7zip on your system
